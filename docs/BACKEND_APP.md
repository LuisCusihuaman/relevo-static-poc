# **RELEVO Backend Architecture**

This document outlines the complete backend architecture for RELEVO, designed to support the full range of specified clinical workflow features. The system's authentication is managed externally by **Clerk** using the **OAuth 2.0** protocol.

The architecture consists of a primary **C\# Backend API** (which validates Clerk's tokens to authorize requests), a specialized **NestJS Service** for all real-time functionalities, and a **NestJS Mock Hospital API** for development.

## **System Architecture & Components**

The architecture strategically separates core business logic (C\# API) from real-time communication and third-party integrations (NestJS Service). This ensures that standard, transactional operations do not interfere with the performance of live collaboration features.

## **Service Responsibilities & Feature Mapping**

### **`relevo-api` (C\# Main Backend) - The Source of Truth**

This service is the system's core, responsible for all business logic and data persistence. It acts as the authority for clinical data and workflow states.

  * **Authentication & Authorization**: Validates JWTs from Clerk on every request. It does not handle user sign-up or password management. User roles (e.g., "Physician", "Nurse") are managed externally within Clerk and included as custom claims within the JWT. The C# backend reads the user's role from the token and dynamically maps it to a specific set of internal application permissions, which are then used to enforce fine-grained access control.
  * **Patient & Clinical Data Management (ðŸ”µ)**: Manages all CRUD operations for patients, clinical notes, and patient assignments to clinicians. To populate initial patient lists for assignment, it fetches roster data via a secure, internal API call to the `nestjs-service` integration hub.
  * **Handover Workflow Logic (ðŸŸ¡)**: Governs the state of the I-PASS handover process (e.g., starting, advancing steps, completing). It handles discrete actions like setting `Illness Severity`, managing the `Action List`, and processing the final `Synthesis by Receiver`.
  * **Data Persistence & Auditing**: Acts as the **sole writer** to the **Oracle Database**. It maintains a comprehensive, immutable audit trail for every state change, crucial for HIPAA compliance. The `AuditService` uses EF Core's `ChangeTracker` to automatically generate detailed audit logs for all data modifications, capturing the before-and-after state of the data. To support the Handover History feature, this service is also responsible for interpreting these logs. The transformation is performed **on-demand** when a user requests the history for a specific handover. It uses a **Strategy Pattern**, where specialized handler classes (e.g., implementing an `IAuditLogHandler` interface) convert the raw JSON data from `AUDIT_LOGS` into a human-readable format. This design keeps the transformation logic modular, testable, and easy to extend.
  * **Search Functionality (ðŸ”µ)**: Powers the `CommandPalette` search feature, querying across patients and clinical data using Oracle Text for efficiency.
  * **Triggering Real-time Events**: After successfully processing a state change (e.g., an updated `Action List` item), it sends a secure, server-to-server HTTP request to the `nestjs-service` to trigger a real-time broadcast to connected clients.
  * **In-Memory Caching**: Implements in-process memory caching for frequently accessed, semi-static data (e.g., hospital unit lists, shift data) to reduce database queries and improve response times for common requests like the **Daily Setup**.

### **`nestjs-service` (NestJS Real-time & Integration Hub)**

This service offloads all real-time and integration tasks from the main API. It authenticates WebSocket connections using the same JWTs from Clerk.

  * **Real-time Collaboration (ðŸ”´)**:
      * **Collaborative Text Editing**: Hosts the **Hocuspocus server** to power the `FullscreenEditor` in collaborative mode (e.g., for `Situation Awareness`).
      * **Live Event Broadcasting**: Manages standard WebSocket connections to broadcast non-text events for the `CollaborationPanel` and `Shift Hub`.
  * **Data Persistence for Real-time Events**: For persisting data generated through real-time interactions (like chat messages or collaborative document changes), the NestJS service makes secure, server-to-server HTTP calls to the main C\# API. This ensures that all data persistence adheres to the centralized business logic, authorization, and auditing rules of the `relevo-api`.
  * **External API Integration (ðŸ”µ)**: Acts as the dedicated gateway for all communication with external hospital systems, keeping these dependencies isolated from the core API. This includes providing an internal API for the C\# backend to securely request data like patient rosters.
  * **Cache Management**: Utilizes in-memory caching to temporarily store data fetched from external hospital APIs or the main C\# API, reducing latency for real-time operations and frequent data requests.

### **`hospital-mock-api` (NestJS Mock Hospital Systems)**

A development-only application that simulates real hospital EMR/EHR APIs. It provides predictable data for units, shifts, patient rosters, and clinical details, enabling parallel development of the frontend and backend.
