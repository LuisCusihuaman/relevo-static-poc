### **Feature Classification Key**

  - **游댮 Real-time Features**: Utilizes technologies like WebSockets for live sync status, session timers, auto-save functionality, and multi-user collaboration indicators.
  - **游리 User-Driven Actions**: Standard, discrete client-side actions like form submissions or selections that trigger a one-time data transaction with the backend.
  - **游댯 External/Backend Data**: Involves API calls to fetch or persist data. This includes fetching initial data from hospital systems (EMR/EHR) and all standard interactions with the RELEVO C\# backend.

### Detailed Flow Description

#### 1\. Daily Setup (`daily-setup`)

This initial phase is a mandatory prerequisite for starting a shift and is a blend of fetching foundational data and capturing direct user input.

  - **Fetching Data (游댯)**: The application initiates API calls to the C\# backend to retrieve foundational data required for the session. This includes lists of medical units and shift times, which may be cached by the backend to improve response times.
  - **User Input & Data Fetching (游댯游리)**: The clinician selects their unit and shift (游리). Based on this, the application fetches a roster of available patients (游댯). The clinician then uses a multi-select interface to assign patients to their shift (游리), which creates the session configuration. The clinician's identity is confirmed automatically via the JWT from the Clerk authentication service.

#### 2\. Main Application Hub (`dashboard`)

The dashboard is a dynamic, real-time feature that serves as the central navigation and status hub for the clinician's entire shift.

  - **Real-time Status (游댮)**: The dashboard displays a grid of the user's assigned patients. The handover status for each patient (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed) is a live indicator, updated in real-time via a WebSocket connection as team members work. This is managed by the NestJS service.
  - **Navigation to Core Features**:
      - **`patient-management` (游댯)**: A view to manage the assigned patient list, which fetches detailed, read-only summaries for each patient from the C\# backend.
      - **`notifications` (游댮)**: An inbox where real-time alerts (e.g., new lab results, urgent messages) are pushed to the user via the NestJS real-time service.
      - **`profile` (游리)**: A standard settings page for managing user preferences (e.g., theme), which are saved via API calls.
      - **`search` (游댯)**: A command palette that allows for rapid, server-side search across all patients and action items, powered by Oracle Text through the C\# API.

#### 3\. Core Handover Workflow (`handover`)

The I-PASS workflow is the application's cornerstone feature for orchestrating a safe and structured transfer of patient care. It is a stateful, collaborative process reliant on real-time synchronization, user actions, and fetching patient data.

  - **`I` - Illness Severity (游리游댮)**: The clinician selects the patient's stability level. This user-driven event (游리) is sent to the C\# backend, which then triggers a real-time broadcast (游댮) to all collaborators via the NestJS service.
  - **`P` - Patient Summary (游댯)**: This view presents a concise summary of the patient's case, pulling the most recent data from the C\# backend, which holds the patient's clinical information.
  - **`A` - Action List (游리游댮)**: A dynamic, shared checklist of tasks. Any team member can add, edit, or check off items (游리), with changes saved to the database and instantly synced via WebSockets to everyone else (游댮).
  - **`S` - Situation Awareness (游댮)**: A collaborative text-editing field powered by Hocuspocus where clinicians can jointly document contingency plans. All contributions are synced live between clients (游댮) and persisted periodically to the database.
  - **`S` - Synthesis by Receiver (游리游댮)**: The final step. The receiving clinician submits their summary of the handover (游리). This action is saved to the C\# backend and serves as the digital sign-off, which triggers a real-time event (游댮) that completes the handover and updates the patient's status on the main dashboard.
