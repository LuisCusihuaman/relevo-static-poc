### **Feature Classification Key**

  - **ðŸ”´ Real-time Features**: Utilizes technologies like WebSockets for live synchronization of data, such as chat, presence indicators, and collaborative text editing.
  - **ðŸŸ¡ User-Driven Actions**: Standard, discrete client-side actions like form submissions or selections that trigger a one-time data transaction with the backend.
  - **ðŸ”µ Backend Data Interaction**: Involves API calls to the C\# backend to fetch or persist data, such as loading historical information or saving new entries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Collaboration & Workflow Integration

This document outlines the application's real-time collaboration capabilities and maps the various entry points into its core clinical workflow.

### 1\. Real-time Collaboration Flow (`CollaborationPanel`)

This flow details user interactions within the `CollaborationPanel`, the central hub for team communication and activity tracking during a live handover session.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User & System Actions"
        A["User opens `CollaborationPanel` ðŸŸ¡"] --> B["Types a message in 'Discussion' tab ðŸŸ¡"]
        A --> C["Another user updates an I-PASS section (e.g., Illness Severity) ðŸŸ¡"]
    end

    subgraph "Data Persistence (C# API ðŸ”µ)"
        F -- "Persists message via POST /patients/{patientId}/messages" --> G["Message saved to Oracle DB ðŸ”µ"]
        H -- "Persists state change" --> I["Handover state saved to Oracle DB ðŸ”µ"]
    end

    subgraph "Real-time Events (NestJS Service ðŸ”´)"
        B -- "Sends WebSocket message" --> D["NestJS gateway receives message"]
        D -- "Broadcasts 'chat:message' event to Socket.IO room" --> E["UI updates with new message for all users ðŸ”´"]
        D -- "Calls C# API to persist" --> F
        
        C -- "Triggers state change in C# API" --> H
        I -- "Triggers internal webhook to NestJS" --> J["NestJS receives webhook (e.g., ILLNESS_SEVERITY_UPDATED)"]
        J -- "Broadcasts 'handover:activity' event" --> K["'Updates' feed is populated for all users ðŸ”´"]
    end

    subgraph "Initial Load (Client-Side ðŸ”µ)"
        A -- "Fetches initial data" --> L["Loads chat history via GET /patients/{patientId}/messages ðŸ”µ"]
        A -- "Fetches initial data" --> M["Loads activity history via GET /handovers/{handoverId}/history ðŸ”µ"]
    end
```

#### **Collaboration Feature Breakdown**

The `CollaborationPanel` is a dynamic sidebar that consolidates team interactions into two distinct tabs: "Discussion" and "Updates" (Activity Feed).

  - **Live Chat & Discussion (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”µ)**: The "Discussion" tab provides a patient-specific chat thread. When a user sends a message (ðŸŸ¡), it is transmitted via a WebSocket to the NestJS service, which then broadcasts a `chat:message` event (ðŸ”´) to all participants in the dedicated Socket.IO room. The NestJS service then makes a `POST /patients/{patientId}/messages` call to the C\# API to persist the message to the database (ðŸ”µ). Initial chat history is loaded via `GET /patients/{patientId}/messages` when the panel opens (ðŸ”µ).

  - **Presence & Activity Indicators (ðŸ”´)**: The panel displays avatars of all clinicians in the session and the "Updates" tab shows a live feed of significant actions. When a user updates an I-PASS section, the C\# API triggers a webhook to the NestJS service (e.g., `ILLNESS_SEVERITY_UPDATED`). The NestJS service then broadcasts a `handover:activity` event to clients, providing at-a-glance awareness of team members' actions.

  - **Typing Indicators (ðŸ”´)**: To improve the flow of conversation, a `chat:typing` event is broadcast when a user is actively typing a message, allowing a "user is typing..." indicator to be displayed in the UI.

  - **Contextual Navigation (ðŸŸ¡)**: The `CollaborationPanel` also serves as a navigation tool. Clicking on an item in the "Updates" feed instantly scrolls the main view to that specific I-PASS section, supporting a more natural, conversational handover.

### 2\. Handover Workflow Integration Map

This diagram illustrates the various pathways a user can take to enter the single, primary clinical workflow: the **`HandoverSession`**. The application provides multiple, context-aware entry points to streamline user access.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "A. Workflow Entry Points (User Actions ðŸŸ¡)"
        A1["Dashboard View: Click 'Start Handover' on patient card"]
        A2["Patient Detail View: Click 'Initiate Handover'"]
        A3["Search (âŒ˜K): Find patient, select 'Handover' action"]
    end

    subgraph "B. Handover Session Initiation"
        A1 & A2 & A3 --> B1["<b>Initiate HandoverSession Workflow</b>"]
        B1 -- "Calls POST /handovers with patientId ðŸ”µ" --> B2["C# API creates new handover record"]
        B2 -- "Returns new handover object" --> B3["Client navigates to HandoverSession view"]
    end

    subgraph "C. The Handover Session"
        B3 -- "Establishes WebSocket connection ðŸ”´" --> C1["Real-time collaborative environment"]
        C1 -- "Fetches full handover state via GET /handovers/{id} ðŸ”µ" --> C2["User completes all I-PASS steps"]
        C2 -- "Final sign-off by receiver via PUT /handovers/{id}/synthesis ðŸŸ¡" --> C3["Handover is logged & status updated"]
        C3 -- "Triggers HANDOVER_STATUS_CHANGED webhook ðŸ”´" --> C4["Dashboard status updates in real-time"]
    end
```

#### **Workflow Integration Details**

  - **Unified Workflow Entry (ðŸŸ¡)**: The application is designed to be context-aware, offering users several convenient ways to access the core `HandoverSession` workflow. A handover can be initiated from:

      * The main `ContextAwareDashboard`.
      * The dedicated `PatientDetailView`.
      * The `CommandPalette` search results.

  - **A Single, Focused Workflow**: Unlike a general-purpose documentation tool, the application funnels users into one primary clinical workflow: the **`HandoverSession`**. This is a formal, stateful session focused on the synchronous transfer of care for a single patient. All clinical documentation (Patient Summary, Situation Awareness, etc.) occurs within the context of this session.

  - **Technical Initiation Flow (ðŸ”µðŸ”´)**: Regardless of the entry point, the process is the same:

    1.  The client sends a `POST /handovers` request containing the `patientId` to the C\# API.
    2.  The API creates a new `HANDOVERS` record in the database, along with its associated collaborative document, and returns the new handover object.
    3.  The client application uses this data to navigate to the `HandoverSession` component, which then establishes a WebSocket connection to the NestJS service for real-time collaboration.
