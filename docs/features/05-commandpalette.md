## 游꿢 Focus Mode Flow (`handover`)

This document outlines the user flow for "Focus Mode," a client-side UI feature within the `handover` workflow designed to minimize distractions and center the user's attention on the core I-PASS content.

### **Focus Mode Feature Breakdown**

[cite\_start]Focus Mode is a purely cosmetic, client-side feature controlled by a simple `focusMode` boolean state within the `handover.tsx` component[cite: 531]. Its sole purpose is to improve user concentration by toggling the visibility of non-essential UI elements.

#### 1\. Activation (User Action 游리)

A user can toggle Focus Mode on or off through two primary methods:

  * [cite\_start]**UI Toggle**: Clicking a dedicated "Focus" icon (`<Maximize2 />`) in the main `Header` component to enter the mode[cite: 518]. [cite\_start]When active, the simplified view contains an "Exit Focus" button to return to the standard layout[cite: 516].
  * [cite\_start]**Keyboard Shortcut**: Pressing the `Escape` key provides a quick method to exit Focus Mode at any time[cite: 533, 534].

This action is a standard `onClick` or `onKeyDown` event that calls `setFocusMode(!focusMode)` to update the local component state.

#### 2\. UI Transformation (Conditional Rendering)

When the `focusMode` state is `true`, the application's JSX uses conditional rendering to alter the layout:

  * [cite\_start]**Hidden Elements**: The standard `Header` and `Footer` components return `null` and are not rendered[cite: 329, 484]. [cite\_start]The sidebars containing the `CollaborationPanel` and `HandoverHistory` are also hidden, as their trigger buttons are located in the main header[cite: 531, 542, 535].
  * [cite\_start]**Expanded Content**: The `MainContent` component detects the `focusMode` prop and renders a different, simplified JSX tree[cite: 332]. This alternative layout removes the multi-column structure, centers the I-PASS sections, and expands them to fill the available space, making text more readable and removing visual clutter. [cite\_start]It includes a minimal header with an "Esc to exit" reminder[cite: 333].

#### 3\. Data and State Classifications

  * **No Data Fetching (游댯)**: Activating Focus Mode does **not** trigger any new API calls or fetch additional data. It simply rearranges and changes the visibility of currently rendered components.
  * **No Real-time Sync (游댮)**: The `focusMode` state is local to each user's session. One clinician entering Focus Mode has no effect on what other collaborators see on their screens. It is not a shared or synced state.
  * [cite\_start]**Client-Side State (游리)**: The entire feature is managed by a single `useState` boolean flag within the top-level `handover` component, making it a purely client-side UI enhancement[cite: 531].

#### 4\. Purpose and User Benefit

The primary benefit of Focus Mode is **reduced cognitive load**. During the critical task of a patient handover, distractions from chat notifications, sidebars, or complex toolbars can be detrimental. Focus Mode provides an "escape hatch" for clinicians to concentrate entirely on the I-PASS content, ensuring that patient information is clearly and accurately communicated without interruption.
